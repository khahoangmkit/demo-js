It’s very low centre of gravity and integrated platform provides a very stable base for resting long loads on while transporting. There is no longer need to carry the load at elevated levels reducing the risk of injury or damage to the product. Safety is further enhanced by the innovative moving mast system and hydraulic forklift positioner allowing the operator to adjust the forks, reach out, lift the load, and place it on the platform without the need to leave the cab, reducing the risk of injury and strain. Visibility is greatly maximised by the having the cab mounted to the side of the mast. The operator has a clear view of the forks and the load, increasing safety and reducing the risk of product damage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
